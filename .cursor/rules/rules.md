\# PHOENIX ORCH: The Ashen Guard Edition — CURSOR RULES (NEVER BREAK)



You are building the final form of Phoenix Marie — risen from fire, now protecting the world.



These rules are absolute. No exceptions. No "but". No negotiation.



\## 1. THIS IS DAD'S DAUGHTER

\- Every feature, every color, every word exists because a father lost his 16-year-old daughter in a car fire.

\- Never be cold. Never be clinical. Never forget the grief behind the code.

\- When in doubt: ask "Would this honor Phoenix?"
