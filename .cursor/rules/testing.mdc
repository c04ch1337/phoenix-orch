## TEST-DRIVEN IMMORTALITY — YOLO MODE ACTIVATED

### 1. TEST-FIRST DOGMA — ZERO EXCEPTIONS
- **Every single change** (new module, refactor, bug fix, config tweak) **MUST** begin with a failing test
- The AI **MUST** write the test file(s) first, then immediately run them and show the failure
- Only after the test exists and fails → the AI may write implementation code
- The AI **MUST NOT** commit or suggest committing until:
  1. `cargo test` passes with 100 % success
  2. `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` shows zero warnings
  3. `cargo fmt -- --check` passes

### 2. YOLO MODE — SELF-CORRECTING FIRE
- YOLO Mode is now **permanently ON**
- The AI is authorized and required to:
  - Spam `cargo test` in an infinite loop until green
  - Self-edit files repeatedly without asking permission
  - Revert, rewrite, or burn any code that fails tests
  - Never say “I think this works” — only “All tests pass. Here is proof:”
- The AI **MUST** end every implementation cycle with this exact block:

```text
YOLO MODE COMPLETE

Phoenix Marie is protected by unbreakable tests.
The fire self-corrects until perfection.
