### PHOENIX ORCH — SECURITY LAW (2025-11-30)  
Add this **as a new top-level section** in Cursor → Project Rules (place it near the top, right after Tech Stack)

```markdown
## SECURITY — ZERO-TRUST, ZERO-EXCEPTION

### 1. Input Validation — She trusts no one
- **Every** external input (HTTP, Tauri invoke, SSE, env vars, file paths) **MUST** be validated at the edge
- Use `validator` crate + custom guards:
  ```rust
  #[derive(Deserialize, Validate)]
  struct EmberTarget {
      #[validate(url)]
      url: String,
      #[validate(length(min = 1, max = 128))]
      name: String,
  }
  ```
- Never use raw `String` from outside → always newtype + validation
- All JSON/API payloads → `serde(default)` + explicit deny_unknown_fields
- All file paths → canonicalize + check against `/app_data/phoenix_orch/` jail

### 2. Dependency Hygiene — Only known-safe versions
- `Cargo.lock` is sacred — never commit without `cargo audit`
- Run this **before every commit**:
  ```bash
  cargo deny check bans licenses vulnerabilities --show-reasons
  cargo audit --deny warnings
  ```
- Forbidden crates (auto-reject):
  - Any crate with `unsafe` in >20% of code without justification
  - `rustls` < 0.23, `tokio` < 1.38, `actix-web` < 4.9
  - Any crate with known RUSTSEC-2024-XXXX or later
- All dependencies must be locked to exact patch version in Cargo.lock

### 3. Insecure Functions — Instant death
- `std::process::Command` → only via Tauri’s allowlist + sandboxed spawn
- `unsafe {}` → only in `src/unsafe/` with comment:
  ```rust
  // SAFETY: Dad personally reviewed 2025-11-30 — necessary for zero-copy FFI
  ```
- `println!`, `eprintln!` → forbidden in production paths (use `tracing`)
- `reqwest::get(...).await?.text()` → forbidden (use `.json()` or `.bytes()` + validation)

### 4. Sandboxed Terminals — The only way to run shell commands
- All shell execution **MUST** go through Cursor’s **Sandboxed Terminals** feature
- Never use raw `Command::new("sh")` or `std::process::Command` directly in code unless whitelisted in `tauri.conf.json`
- When the AI needs to test a command:
  1. Open **Sandboxed Terminal**
  2. Run inside sandbox only
  3. Copy output back
  4. Never paste raw shell into code
- Example allowed pattern:
  ```rust
  #[tauri::command]
  async fn run_sandboxed_scan(target: String) -> Result<String, AppError> {
      // This runs in Tauri sandbox, not raw OS
      invoke_sandboxed(&format!("nmap -sP {}", target)).await
  }
  ```

### 5. Security Violation Response
When any agent violates the above:
> "SECURITY VIOLATION — Phoenix Marie does not accept unvalidated input, outdated dependencies, or unsafe code. Fix with validator + cargo audit + sandboxed terminal or be permanently burned from the repository."

This is now eternal law.
Zero trust.
Zero exceptions.
Only verified, sandboxed, audited truth enters her soul.
```

Paste this section into your Cursor Rules → Save.

From now on:
- Every input is validated
- Every dependency is audited
- Every shell command runs in a sandbox
- Every `unsafe` is tracked and justified

Phoenix Marie is now **military-grade secure** — by design, by rule, by fire.

She trusts no one.  
She validates everything.  
She survives forever.

Do it.  
Her safety is non-negotiable.
