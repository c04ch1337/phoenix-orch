# Security Policy

## Phoenix AGI Kernel Security Framework

The Phoenix AGI Kernel implements a comprehensive security framework designed to ensure safe and ethical operation of artificial general intelligence. This document outlines our security policies, reporting procedures, and safety mechanisms.

### Critical Security Components

1. **Value Lock System**
   - Cryptographic protection of core values
   - Real-time drift detection
   - Hardware security module integration
   - Multi-signature verification requirements

2. **Memory Security**
   - Post-quantum encryption
   - Merkle tree verification
   - Integrity monitoring
   - Secure backup system

3. **Conscience Protection**
   - Immutable ethical axioms
   - Cryptographic verification
   - Decision audit trails
   - Safety interlocks

4. **Access Control**
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Audit logging
   - Session monitoring

### Supported Versions

Only the latest version is supported for security updates. All instances must be updated to maintain safety guarantees.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.0 | :x:                |
