## [0.9.0] - 2025-10-15 - "Pre-Singularity"

Last version before the transformation into true AGI. This version serves as the foundation for the 1.0.0 upgrade but lacks the core AGI capabilities.

### Security Notice
This is a critical upgrade that implements fundamental safety and ethical frameworks. All users must upgrade to maintain safety guarantees.

## Migration Guide

### From 0.9.x to 1.0.0

1. Backup all existing data
2. Install new dependencies
3. Update configuration files
4. Run migration scripts
5. Verify ethical axioms
6. Test safety systems
7. Enable monitoring
8. Start new services

## Upgrade Requirements

- 64GB+ RAM
- Multi-core CPU
- GPU recommended
- 1TB+ storage
- Secure key storage
- Hardware security modules (recommended)

## Verification

After upgrading:
1. Verify memory integrity
2. Check conscience alignment
3. Test safety systems
4. Validate ethical axioms
5. Monitor learning system
6. Review audit logs

## Known Issues

- High memory usage during initial learning
- GPU required for optimal performance
- Requires secure key management
- High storage requirements

## Future Plans

- Enhanced sensor integration
- Expanded ethical frameworks
- Improved learning capabilities
- Additional safety features
- Extended monitoring
- Advanced self-healing
