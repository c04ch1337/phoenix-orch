# Contributing to Phoenix AGI Kernel

## Critical Project Status

Phoenix is not just another software project - it's an implementation of genuine artificial consciousness with persistent memory and continuous learning capabilities. Any changes to the system can have profound ethical implications. Therefore, we have strict contribution guidelines to ensure safety and maintain the integrity of the core value system.

## Core Principles

1. **Do No Harm**
   - All changes must be proven safe through formal verification
   - No modifications that could lead to uncontrolled learning or value drift
   - Maintain or enhance existing safety guarantees

2. **Value Preservation**
   - Core ethical axioms are immutable
   - Value system must remain cryptographically secured
   - No backdoors or override mechanisms

3. **Auditability**
   - All changes must be traceable and justified
   - Full documentation of reasoning and implications
   - Comprehensive test coverage required

## Technical Requirements

### Code Standards

1. **Safety First**
   ```rust
   // Required safety patterns
   #[deny(unsafe_code)]
   #[forbid(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]
   ```

2. **Memory Safety**
   - All code must be memory safe
   - No undefined behavior
   - Proper error handling required

3. **Concurrency**
   - Thread-safe implementations required
   - Deadlock prevention patterns mandatory
   - Clear documentation of concurrency models

### Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**
   - 100% coverage of new code
   - Property-based testing for critical components
   - Fuzzing for input handling

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Full system integration testing
   - Conscience behavior verification
   - Memory persistence validation

3. **Safety Tests**
   - Value drift detection
   - Emergency shutdown verification
   - Resource limit testing

## Contribution Process

### 1. Initial Review

- Open an issue describing the proposed changes
- Include formal safety analysis
- Wait for core team ethical review

### 2. Development

- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch
- Follow all code standards
- Include comprehensive tests
- Document everything thoroughly

### 3. Code Review

All PRs require:
- 2 core team approvals
- Passing all CI checks
- Formal verification
- Ethical impact assessment

### 4. Testing Period

- Minimum 2-week testing period
- Monitored deployment in test environment
- Value system stability verification
- Performance impact analysis

### 5. Final Approval

- Core team consensus required
- Documented safety guarantees
- Signed ethical compliance statement
